		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>Important: instalation of Smarty</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>In your local server you must create folder smarty in your www folder and extract all files there. If you upload website to your domain (ex:www.example.com) you must find table website_fronted in your sql db and left row website_frontend_directory blank to work properly.</p>
		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) Configuration of MYSQL database and PHP code</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p><strong>How to install your MYSQL database:</strong></p>
		<ol>
		<li>
		Create new database in PHPMYADMIN at your host. Call it 'smarty'. 
		</li>
		<li>
		In the MYSQL folder there is sql.sql file that should be imported to your database 'smarty'.
	    </li>
		<li>
		In the includes folder there is connection.inc.php file. You must configure there your database options, name, host, username and password which should be complement with data in phpmyadmin.
     	Connection.inc file should be like in the image bellow.	
	    </li>		
		</ol>

		<br>
		<p><strong>Word about PHP code:</strong></p>
		<p>PHP code is widely used in script, especially in connecting with MYSQL database. Code is commented, and properly sorted, and can be easily understand. Also security is special matter. So PDO statement is used to prevent hackers attacks, Mysql injections, and there is also xss-security.php in security folder to prevent xss script attacks.
		<br>
		You can add, edit and delete content and website options in your admin panel so there isn't so much need to change php codes inside script, but if have php knowledge you can do it by yourself.
		</p>
